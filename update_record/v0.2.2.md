# Update record for version 0.2.2

## Fixing

- Fix the bug of potential data type incompatibility during image resizing.
- Fix the bug of missing enum member like `NUMPY`, `CV_MAT`, and `TORCH`, making the code build on old version of `faye-image` incompatible with the new version.
- Fix the bug of missing mode during PNG loading.
